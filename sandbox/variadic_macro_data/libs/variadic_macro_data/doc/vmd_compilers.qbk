[section:vmd_compilers Compilers]

I have tested this library using gcc/MingW and VC++ on Windows. The 
compilers tested are gcc 3.3.3, 3.4.2, 3.4.5, 4.3.0, 4.4.0, 4.5.0-1, 4.5.2-1
and VC++ 8.0, 9.0, 10.0. Other compilers which currently should work with this 
library are gcc on Linux, Digital Mars C++, and Borland C++ Builder 6/Codegear C++.

As of Boost 1.4.5 the macro BOOST\_NO\_VARIADIC\_MACROS is supported.
This library could be used with previous Boost 
installations but there would be no guarantee that the compilers for which 
one wanted to use this library actually support variadic macros.

In 'pplib' mode the compilers supported are those which are deemed to 
offer C99 variadic macro support for Boost PP.
