/** \def BOOST_VMD_PP_TUPLE_SIZE(tuple)

    \brief Expands to the number of elements in a tuple.

    tuple = a Boost PP library tuple data type.

    returns = the number of elements in the tuple,
              commonly referred to as the tuple size.
              
    In the Boost PP library there is no way to calculate
    the size of a tuple, so that the size must be known
    in order to be used by Boost PP library tuple macros.
    With variadic macros the size of a tuple can be
    calculated from the tuple itself.

/** \def BOOST_VMD_PP_TUPLE_ELEM(n,tuple)

    \brief Expands to a particular tuple element.

    n   = number of the tuple element.
          The number starts from 0 to the size of
          the tuple - 1.
          
    tuple = a Boost PP library tuple data type.

    returns = the particular tuple element as specified
              by n.
              
    In the Boost PP library there is no way to calculate 
    the size of a tuple, so that the size must be known 
    in order to be used by Boost PP library tuple macros.
    With variadic macros the size of a tuple can be 
    calculated from the tuple itself.
    
    Therefore this macro is a replacement for the BOOST_PP_TUPLE_ELEM
    macro without the necessity of having to pass a size.

/** \def BOOST_VMD_PP_TUPLE_REM_CTOR(tuple)

    \brief Expands to a series of tokens which are equivalent to removing the parentheses from a tuple.

    tuple = a Boost PP library tuple data type.

    returns = a series of comma-separated tokens equivalent to removing the parentheses from a tuple.
    
              This result is actually equivalent to the form of variadic macro data
              and can be used as an alternative to BOOST_VMD_PP_TUPLE_TO_DATA to convert
              the tuple to variadic macro data.
              
    In the Boost PP library there is no way to calculate 
    the size of a tuple, so that the size must be known 
    in order to be used by Boost PP library tuple macros.

    \brief Expands to a tuple whose elements are in reversed order.

    tuple = a Boost PP library tuple data type.

    returns = a tuple whose elements are in reversed order
              from the original tuple.

    the size of a tuple, so that the size must be known
