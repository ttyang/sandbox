[section:binaryoperable BinaryOperable (Connectable, OnlyConnectable, Disconnectable, Extractable) ]

A [ProducerPort] `P` and [ConsumerPort] `C` are /BinaryOperable/
for a binary operation `O`, and mechanism `M`, if the implementation of
the binary operation `O` has been specialized for `M`, `P`, and `C`.

In this case,

* If `O` is operations::connect, `P` and `C` are [Connectable]
* If `O` is operations::connect_only, `P` and `C` are [OnlyConnectable]
* If `O` is operations::disconnect, `P` and `C` are [Disconnectable]
* If `O` is operations::extract, `P` and `C` are [Extractable]
