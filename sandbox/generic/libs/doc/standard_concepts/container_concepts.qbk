[section:container_concepts C[']ontainer Concepts]

[heading Overview]
The concepts presented in this section describe requirements on the template
arguments used in container adaptors. It contains two sets of container
concepts, one that uses non-member functions and the other that uses member
functions. A set of concept map templates adapts the member function syntax (the
way most containers are implemented) to free-function syntax (which is used by
most generic functions, because of its flexibility).

Inclusion of the concepts of this section may be done in one of two ways:

 // Include all of the <container_concepts> concepts
 #include <boost/generic/std_concept/container_concepts.hpp>

 // -or-

 // Include the <container_concepts> concepts on a case-by-case basis
 #include <boost/generic/std_concept/container_concepts/back_emplacement_container.hpp>
 #include <boost/generic/std_concept/container_concepts/back_insertion_container.hpp>
 // etc.
