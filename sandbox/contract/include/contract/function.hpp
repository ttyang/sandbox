/**
@brief Macro used to declare free functions, free function operators, member
functions, and member function operators with contracts.

This macro is used to declare a function with possible preconditions and
postconditions.
At least all public member functions and public member function operators of a
class with non-empty class invariants should be declared using this macro in
order to check the class invariants (even if the functions and operators have
no precondition and no postcondition).

The semantics of a call to a function with contracts are explained in the
@RefSect{contract_programming_overview, Contract Programming Overview} section.
Constructors and destructors are declared using the
@RefMacro{CONTRACT_CONSTRUCTOR} and @RefMacro{CONTRACT_DESTRUCTOR} macros
respectively.

@Params
@Param{function_declaration,
The function declaration syntax is explained in the @RefSect{grammar\, Grammar}
section.
Member functions must always repeat their access level <c>public</c>\,
<c>protected</c>\, or <c>private</c>.
Operators use a special syntax to specify their symbols and names.
}
@EndParams

The @RefMacro{CONTRACT_CLASS} macro must be used to declare classes enclosing
member functions and member function operators declared using this macro.

Within a type-dependent scope (e.g., within templates), the
@RefMacro{CONTRACT_FUNCTION_TPL} macro must be used instead of this macro.

The @RefMacro{CONTRACT_FREE_BODY} and @RefMacro{CONTRACT_MEMBER_BODY} macros
must be used when separating free and member function body definitions from the
function declarations programmed using this macro.

@SeeAlso @RefSect{tutorial, Tutorial} section.
