/**
@brief Macro used to declare classes with contracts.

This macro is used to declare a class with class invariants and member
functions with preconditions and postconditions.
A class declared with this macro must always specify (possibly empty) class
invariants using the @RefMacro{CONTRACT_CLASS_INVARIANT} macro.

Constructors, destructors, and member functions with contracts are declared
using the @RefMacro{CONTRACT_CONSTRUCTOR}, @RefMacro{CONTRACT_DESTRUCTOR}, and
@RefMacro{CONTRACT_FUNCTION} macros respectively.
The semantics of calls to constructors, destructors, and member functions with
contracts are explained in the
@RefSect{contract_programming_overview, Contract Programming Overview} section.

@Params
@Param{class_declaration,
The class declaration syntax is explained in the @RefSect{grammar\, Grammar}
section.
If present\, base classes must be specified using <c>extends( ... )</c>.
}
@EndParams

Nested classes with contracts are also declared using this macro but they must
always repeat their access level <c>public</c>, <c>protected</c>, or
<c>private</c>.
Within a type-dependent scope, nested classes with contracts must be declared
using the @RefMacro{CONTRACT_CLASS_TPL} macro.

@SeeAlso @RefSect{tutorial, Tutorial} section.
