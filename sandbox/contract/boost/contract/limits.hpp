@brief Upper bound on possible maximum number of postcondition old variables.

The maximum possible number of postcondition old variables is <c>15</c> (the
actual maximum value is controlled by
@RefMacro{BOOST_CONTRACT_CONFIG_OLDOF_MAX}).

For compilers that do not support variadic macros, this is the maximum possible
total number of postcondition statements (total of old variable declarations,
plus return value declaration, plus assertions, etc).

@Note This is not a configuration macro.
The value of this macro is fixed and programmers cannot change it.
