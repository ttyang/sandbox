/** @file
@brief Macros used to configure the library behaviour at compile-time (this
header is automatically included by <c>contract.hpp</c>).

These configuration macros have appropriate default values if left undefined.
Programmers can define these macros before including any of the library headers
(using compiler options like <c>-D</c> for GCC, <c>/D</c> for MSVC, etc) in
order to change the library behaviour.

The macros @RefMacro{BOOST_CONTRACT_CONFIG_NO_PRECONDITIONS},
@RefMacro{BOOST_CONTRACT_CONFIG_NO_POSTCONDITIONS}, etc can be defined to
selectively disable compilation and run-time checking of all preconditions,
postconditions, etc.
This is a common practice in Contract Programming to generate debug and release
builds with less correctness checks but faster run-times.
Note that all contracts are compiled and checked at run-time by default unless
specified otherwise using these configuration macros.

@SeeAlso @RefSect{getting_started, Getting Started} section,
@RefSect{contract_programming_overview, Contract Programming Overview} section.
