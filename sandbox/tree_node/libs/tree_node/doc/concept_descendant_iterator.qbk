[section:tree_node_desc_iterator Tree Node Descendant Iterator]

[section Description]
This concept may seem redundant at first, especially when iterating through
__Non_Associative_Tree_Node__ objects; however, for __Associative_Tree_Node__
objects, models of this concept provide the sole means of accessing the key
associated with each node being traversed.  (Root nodes are not associated with
keys at the tree node level, so models of this concept do not traverse them.)

[variablelist Notation
    [
        [`Iterator`]
        [A type that models the [*Tree Node Descendant Iterator] concept.]
    ]
    [
        [`itr`]
        [An object of type `Iterator`.]
    ]
    [
        [`Node`]
        [A type that models the __Tree_Node__ concept.]
    ]
    [
        [`node`]
        [An object of type `Node&`.]
    ]
]

[section:types Associated Types]
No additional types beyond those defined in the __Tree_Node_Iterator__ concept;
however, the requirements for the value type are strengthened: it must be the
appropriate iterator type of `Node`.
[endsect]

[section:expressions Valid Expressions and Semantics]
None beyond those defined in the __Tree_Node_Iterator__ concept; however, the
type requirements for the constructors are strengthened, and their semantics
are clarified.
